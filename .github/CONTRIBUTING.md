# Support the Neos Project development with bounties

The Neos project has not founded its own association or any other formal legal body. Thus it is not possible to directly donate to the Neos project. Sandstorm want to support the Neos project as best as we can, including financially. Sandstorm have therefore agreed with the Neos team to sell Neos supporter badges and use all revenues to support the Neos project. [Check the official funding website][5]
